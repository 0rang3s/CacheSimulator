# CacheSimulator
CacheSimulator Assignment for CSCI 2122! 

## Overview 
This cache simulator project focuses on implementing a fully associative cache memory system. The cache memory is simulated using a C program capable of handling memory accesses, cache hits, and cache misses.

## Structure 
Project Structure
The project consists of the following files:

cache.h: Header file containing the declarations of functions and structures used in the cache simulator.
cache.c: Source file implementing the cache simulator functions.
main.c: Provided by the professor, containing test cases to evaluate the functionality of the cache simulator.
tests - Contact me for test cases! 

## Features
- Fully Associative Cache: The cache simulator implements a fully associative cache memory system.
- LRU Replacement Policy: The simulator employs the Least Recently Used (LRU) policy to replace cache lines upon cache misses.
- Memory Access Handling: Handles memory accesses efficiently, loading data from main memory into the cache when necessary.
- Detailed Testing: Provides detailed test cases to validate the functionality and performance of the cache simulator.

## Dependencies
Standard C libraries (stdio.h, stdlib.h, assert.h, string.h)
